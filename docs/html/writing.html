        <h3>The Craft of Writing</h3>
            <p>Writing makes you think - what do you want to communicate, what
            point are you trying to make, who are you communicating with? The
            act of writing hones mastery, and we believe in communicating information
            that is clear, concise and readable. We provide all of our articles
            and papers for free, and we aim to provide a distraction-free environment
            to learn. While there is an abundance of information in textbooks,
            on the internet and in scientific journals, it can be overwhelming to
            read complex, complicated documents that are more about the writer's
            ego than the reader, or navigate websites that are covered with ads
            and distracting gimmicks. We hope you find our articles fun and easy to
            read, but most importantly, enlightening.</p>

            <p>There is relatively broad range of topics in the articles below,
            ranging from business analysis to international relations to academic
            computer science papers, but all have a common theme; using analytical
            thinking to understand and improve the world around us. Feel free to
            read any of the papers, ask questions and let us know if you have any
            comments or suggestions.</p>

        <h4>R Programming</h4>
            <p>'R' is a statistical programming language used by many (if
              not most) data scientists. Learning to interact with 'R' is an
              essential skill for data science, although if you have never
              programmed before, the learning curve can be steep. All of these
              articles treat learning 'R' in a fun and approachable way.</p>
