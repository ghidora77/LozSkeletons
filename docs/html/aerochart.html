        <h3>Aeronautical Charting</h3>
            <p>We met with the Geospatial Information Firm, <a href="http://www.terraveta.com/">
            <i>TerraVeta</i></a>, in the fall
            of 2018 to develop automation tools for mapping aviation charts.
            These important and complicated graphical documents provide essential information
            to the aviation community, and have to be constructed with precision
            and attention to detail. With <i>TerraVeta's</i> expertise in the field
            and our excitement in tackling unique data and
            automation challenges, we successfully built a simple, intuitive system that
            allows the user to build error-free aviation charts instantaneously.

        <h4>The Project</h4>
            <p>Here's a sample of an aviation chart, which in this case describes
                how a pilot would fly into a specific airfield following a specific approach
                procedure.</p>
            <img src="../images/AviationChart.png" alt="aviation" align = center >
            <p style="margin-top: 2%">
            As you can see, there's a significant amount of information, including
            safety warnings, terrain contours, communication frequencies, geospatial
            data, and any relevant information that affects flight safety.
            No two charts are the same, and the information
            that is needed on each chart changes based on many shifting criteria,
            which makes this a tricky problem for automation. Our approach to the
            problem was simple:
                <h5 style="color:darkred;"> <b> Clean Data -> Simple Code </b> </h5>
            We broke the problem down into two major sections
             </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Data
                      <ul>
                          <li>What data do we need?</li>
                          <li>Where is the data located?</li>
                          <li>Is the data we obtain accurate?</li>
                          <li>What data transformations do we need to complete?</li>
                          <li>What calculations are required?</li>
                          <li>What is the best output to ensure proper plotting ?</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>


                  <li> Programming
                      <ul>
                          <li>What information is essential?</li>
                          <li>Which decisions cascade into the way other pieces of the chart are plotted? </li>
                          <li>What logic do we embed into each piece?</li>
                          <li>Which segments need dynamic logic, and how do we determine
                              the priorities within the programming environment?</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>


            <p>We'll go into more detail on each of these segments, but in a complicated
            problem like this, it is essential to ask as many questions up front and
        determine a general plan. </p>

        <h4>Data Engineering</h4>
            <p>If you're familiar with working with data, it normally falls into one of
            two categories - either a chaotic mess filled with erroneous information
            that is incredibly difficult to navigate through, or massive amounts of information
            that takes time to map the endless relationships. This project falls more
            into the latter category, as we used a government database with a clear maintenance
            plan and feedback loop. However, we had to create a logical, formulaic approach
            to make sure we were extracting only the data that was absolutely necessary,
            and no more - otherwise, the sheer volume of information would overwhelm our approach.
            We started by using a workflow tool, in this case <a href="https://www.alteryx.com/">Alteryx</a>.  Alteryx does an
            excellent job of allowing you to quickly join to databases, extract, blend, transform, mutate and
            perform calculations, and is our preferred tool at the start of any data project. Here is
            a segment of our workflow, where we extract data from several different places
            and turned it into a format that we could work with.  We're Alteryx junkies,
            and did our basic and advanced certification in the tool, so if you have
            specific questions about our process, please contact us.</p>

            <img src="../images/Alteryx.png" alt="alteryx" align = center style="width:800px;height:450px;">

            <p>To give you a more detailed view of one segment of the workflow, in the content below we completed
                twenty different data transformation steps to take unformatted communication data
                and create a hierarchy of frequencies based on what information is available
                and which communication frequencies take precendence. We filter data
                based on the airfield, determine what type of frequency it is (based on
                the spectrum), remove any frequencies that would not be needed based on the
                approach procedure, renamed the frequency types to create a hierarchy,
                removed bad or unused frequencies, grouped them by type and used logic to
                extract the number needed. We then turned this into a standard
                numerical array, so the object oriented programming can plot this
                information based on their own logic.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/AlteryxComm.png" alt="alteryx" align = center style = "width:1000px;height:200px;">

            <p>Alteryx is an excellent tool to build an automated data transformation
            workflow, but we're often asked to provide a low-cost solution that would
            accomodate many users and give full control to the data engineers and mappers, so we
            transitioned to the well-established, open-source statistical modeling programming
            language 'R'. 'R' is the preferred tool of data scientists and engineers,
            with robust capabilities in everything from data transformation to machine
            learning and prediction modeling. While Alteryx provides ease of use and
            a visual understanding of the process, 'R''s scalability was the natural
            choice when having to build an automation tool that numerous people would be
            interacting with. If you're familiar with 'R', we put a heavy reliance on the
            'Tidyvere' methodology, and 'sf', 'Raster' and 'spData' to build geospatial
            buffers that pull in the relevant navigational aids. We made sure that everything
            we did within 'R' was commented and explained, to ensure that anyone on our
            team could pickup and interact with the code. Here's a snippet, the entire
            sequence included about 1500 lines of code. Again, if you have any specific questions
            about the process or 'R', please contact us.  </p>

        <h4>Programming </h4>
            <p>The plotting is done in Microstation, a CAD software that is popular in
                many government engineering circles. In the previous process, the user
                would have to go through one of the governmen databases, excel spreadsheets
                or Access databases, find the information that they needed, and physically
                type it into the CAD software.
                Geospatial information was plotted individually and
                most of the information had to be manually plotted, one piece at a time. Our
                methodology was to rethink the entire process, start from scratch and
                develop a natural order to populating the chart. We
                analyzed the document, went word by word and symbol by symbol
                and mapped out how to get the data from the database
                into Microstation instantaneously, in the exact correct position
                without error.  Each chart is completely different,
                fully dependent on the location and the approach procedure, so our programming
                had to have a heavy component of both logical programming and adaptability. In the image
                below, you can see a large chart with very important information about altitude minimums.
                The number of values, the columns, and the values themselves are all calculated
                based on the terrain - There is a supplemental tool that will determine this
                information, and we automatically plotted this information into the CAD software.
             </p>

                <img src="../images/mins.png" alt="mins" align = center >
            <p>Our programming philosophy is perhaps most similar to Agile methodology. We spend
                quality time understanding all the pieces of what needs to get done,
                we define the end goal very clearly, and We break
                the entire project into as many different segments as possible, with a very flexible
                plan of how these segments connect. In
                our experience the traditional 'waterfall' methodology, which creates a specific plan
                with each step clearly defined, associated with timelines and developed sequentially
                rarely works - things never go to plan, and adaptability is much more important. Afterall,
                we learn best by seeing what doesn't work, and we make progress by figuring out
                how to transfer small successes into the other pieces of the project. At the end,
                once our strategy worked and we got each piece to plot, we went back
                and refactored our code for efficiency and optimization.  </p>


            <p>We initially started developing in the Microstation Development Language, which is
            close to 'C' programming, but due to the lack of resources in some segments of the project,
            we shifted to Visual Basic, which Microstation supports. VBA is a very common
            language with large user groups, and is easy to learn if you have familiarity with
            other programming languages. One of the most challenging aspects of this project was
            the shifting criteria and hierarchies. For instance, the government organization that maintains
            this development contract has several pages of criteria when determining which frequencies
            to publish, in which order, and the location on the page. Our code had to be dynamic
            enough to adapt to this type of programming, while at the same time
            avoiding hundred-line 'if-statements'. To succeed, we created a unique framework with
            cascading logic that mimics the computer science principle of binary search -
            if one event happens, then we can eliminate different chains of possibilities. </p>

        <h4>Summary </h4>
            <p>With a few months of planning beforehand, and a week-long session of intense
                development work at TerraVeta's office in Saint Louis, we successfully
                built automation software that plotted a majority of the chart
                in question, leaving the users to focus on more important tasks that
                involve human interpretation by aviation professionals and quality
                assurance. TerraVeta's domain expertise in aviation was absolutely
                essential, as their knowledge about the intricacies and what is needed
                helped us quickly hone a plan and build a system that works.

                After several weeks of debugging, testing and trying to
                break the software any way we could, there have been no errors noted,
                and we reduced hours worth of work down to a few seconds.
                We eventually sold the software to the main government contractor,
                a Fortune 30 company, and are expanding our plans for automation
                development work in several different industries, including aviation.
                Overall, we learned that developing a flexible approach that breaks
                large projects into smaller chunks and pairing with experts in the
                domain will be our approach to all of our future development work.

             </p>
            <p>No matter the industry or the process, contact us if you have some
                ideas on automating a process. We're always up for the challenge. </p>
