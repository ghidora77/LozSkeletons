        <h3>Aeronautical Charting</h3>
            <p>We met with the Geospatial Information Firm,
            <a href="http://www.terraveta.com/"><i>TerraVeta</i></a>,
            in the summer of 2018 to develop automation software for mapping aviation charts.
            These important and complicated graphical documents provide essential information
            to the aviation community, and have to be constructed with precision
            and attention to detail. With <i>TerraVeta's</i> expertise in the aviation field
            and our excitement in tackling unique data and automation challenges,
            we successfully built a simple, intuitive system that converted a manual,
            time-intensive process into an automated, error-free solution.

        <h4>The Project</h4>
            <p>Here's a sample aviation chart, which in this case describes
            how a pilot would fly into a specific airport following a specific approach
            procedure.</p>

            <img src="../images/AviationChart.png" alt="aviation" align = center >

            <p style="margin-top: 2%">
            There's a significant amount of information, including
            safety warnings, terrain contours, communication frequencies, geospatial
            data, and other instructions that affect flight safety. No two charts
            are the same, and the information that is needed on each chart changes
            based on shifting criteria, which makes this a tricky problem when building
            an automated solution. Creating these charts is a manual process
            done by technicians with a strong background and understanding in aeronautics -
            our goal was to save as much time as possible by extracting data from a
            large database, cleaning and transforming the information, and then
            accurately plotting the correct data onto the chart with perfect accuracy.
            Our approach to the problem was simple:
            </p>

            <h5 style="color:darkred;"> <b>Clean Data -> Simple Code </b> </h5>

            <p>We broke the project down into two major sections, and spent several weeks
            asking as many questions as we could and testing out possible solutions.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li> Data
                  <ul>
                      <li>What data do we need?</li>
                      <li>Where is the data located?</li>
                      <li>Is the data we obtain accurate?</li>
                      <li>What data transformations do we need to complete?</li>
                      <li>What calculations are required?</li>
                      <li>What is the best output to ensure proper plotting ?</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>

              <li> Programming
                  <ul>
                      <li>What information is essential?</li>
                      <li>Which decisions cascade into the way other pieces of the chart are plotted? </li>
                      <li>What logic do we embed into each piece?</li>
                      <li>Which segments need dynamic logic, and how do we determine
                          the priorities within the programming environment?</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>In a complicated problem like this, it is essential to ask as many questions up front and
            determine a general plan, then break up the work into numerous small,
            attainable segments. </p>

        <h4>Data Engineering</h4>
            <p>If you're familiar with working with data, the data environment normally fall into one of
            two categories: either a chaotic mess filled with erroneous information
            that is incredibly difficult to navigate through, or massive amounts of information
            that take time to map the endless relationships. This project falls more
            into the latter category, as we used a government database with a clear maintenance
            plan and feedback loop. However, we had to create a logical, formulaic approach
            to make sure we were extracting only the data that was absolutely necessary,
            and no more - otherwise, the sheer volume of information would overwhelm our approach.
            We started by using a workflow tool, in this case
            <a href="https://www.alteryx.com/">Alteryx</a>.
            Alteryx does an excellent job of allowing you to quickly join to databases,
            extract, blend, transform, mutate and perform calculations, and is
            our preferred tool at the start of any data project. Alteryx is our preferred tool
            in connecting with and understanding our data - while it has great tools
            for prediction modeling, machine learning and optimization, we didn't use
            any in this case. We did our basic and advanced certification in Alteryx, so if you have
            specific questions about our process, please <a href="mailto:ozzy@loz.vision">contact us</a>. Here is
            a segment of our workflow, where we extract data from several different places
            and molded it into a format that we could work with.</p>

            <img src="../images/Alteryx.png" alt="alteryx" align = center style="width:800px;height:450px;">

            <p style="margin-top: 2%">To give you a more detailed view of one segment of the workflow, in the image below we completed
            twenty different data transformation steps to take unformatted communication data
            and create a hierarchy of frequencies based on what information is available
            and which communication frequencies take precendence. Starting from the left, We filter data
            based on the airfield, determine what type of frequency it is (based on
            the spectrum), remove any frequencies that would not be needed based on the
            approach procedure, rename the frequency types to create a hierarchy,
            remove bad or unused frequencies, group them by type and use logic to
            extract the frequencies needed. We then convert this into a standard
            numerical array, so the object oriented programming in the next step
            can plot this information based on their own logic.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/AlteryxComm.png" alt="alteryx" align = center style = "width:1000px;height:200px;">

            <p style="margin-top: 2%">Alteryx is an excellent tool to build an automated data transformation
            workflow, but to provide a low-cost solution that would
            accomodate many users and give full control to the data engineers and mappers, we
            transitioned to the well-established, open-source statistical modeling programming
            language 'R'. 'R' is the preferred tool of data scientists and engineers,
            with robust capabilities in everything from data transformation to machine
            learning and prediction modeling. While Alteryx provides ease of use and
            a visual understanding of the process very rapidly, 'R''s scalability was the natural
            choice when having to build an automation tool that numerous people would be
            using in a limited manner. Our solution built an interface for ease of use,
            while the scripts themselves form the backbone of the data platform. If you're
            familiar with 'R', we put a heavy reliance on the 'Tidyvere' methodology,
            and use the 'sf', 'Raster' and 'spData' packages to build geospatial
            buffers that pull in the relevant navigational aids based on their
            latitude and longitude. We ensured that everything
            we did within 'R' was commented and documented, to ensure that anyone on our
            team could pickup and interact with the code. Here's a snippet, the entire
            sequence included about 1000 lines of code. Again, if you have any specific questions
            about the process or 'R', please contact us.  </p>

        <h4>Programming </h4>
            <p>Putting all the text and symbols onto the page
            is done in Microstation, CAD software that is popular in
            many government engineering circles. Previously, the user
            would have to go through different databases, excel spreadsheets
            or Access files, find the information that they needed,
            make calculations and physically type it into CAD.
            Geospatial information was plotted individually and
            most of the information had to be manually plotted, one piece at a time. Our
            methodology was to rethink the entire process, start from scratch and
            develop a natural order to populating the chart. We
            analyzed the document, went word by word and symbol by symbol
            and mapped out how to get the data from the database
            into Microstation instantaneously, in the exact correct position
            without error. Each chart is completely different,
            fully dependent on the location and the approach procedure, so our programming
            had to be both logical and adaptive to shifting criteria. In the image
            below, you can see a segment of the chart with very important information about
            the minimum altitude along the path the aircraft takes towards landing.
            Every piece of chart is calculated based on the terrain in a supplemental
            tool, and we automatically plotted this information into the CAD software.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/mins.png" alt="mins" align = center >

            <p>Our programming philosophy is perhaps most similar to Agile methodology. We spend
            quality time understanding all the pieces of what needs to get done,
            we define the end goal very clearly, and we break
            the entire project into as many different segments as possible, with a very flexible
            plan of how these segments connect. In
            our experience, the traditional 'waterfall' methodology, which creates a specific plan
            with each step clearly defined, associated with timelines and developed sequentially
            rarely works - things never go to plan, and adaptability is much more important. Afterall,
            we learn best by seeing what doesn't work, and we make progress by figuring out
            how to transfer small successes into the other pieces of the project. At the end,
            once our strategy worked and we got each piece to plot, we went back
            and refactored our code for efficiency and optimization.
            </p>

            <p>We initially started developing in the Microstation Development Language, which is
            close to the 'C' programming language that we have experience in,
            but due to the lack of resources in some segments of the project,
            we shifted to <i>Visual Basic</i> (VBA), which Microstation supports. VBA is a very common
            language with large user groups, and is easy to learn if you have familiarity with
            other programming languages. One of the most challenging aspects of this project was
            the shifting criteria and hierarchies. For instance, the government organization that maintains
            this development contract has several pages of criteria when determining which frequencies
            to publish, in which order, and the location on the page. Our code had to be dynamic
            enough to adapt to this type of programming, while at the same time
            avoiding inefficient, hundred-line 'if-statements'. To succeed, we created a unique framework with
            cascading logic that mimics the computer science principle of binary search -
            if one event happens, then we can eliminate different chains of possibilities.
            In general, we programmed with the mentality that certain parameters or requirements
            could shift at any given time, and the code had to be dynamic enough to
            accomodate.

        <h4>Summary </h4>
            <p>With a few months of planning beforehand, and a week-long session of intense
            development work at <i>TerraVeta's</i> office in Saint Louis, we successfully
            built automation software that plotted a majority of the chart
            in question, leaving aviation professionals to focus on more important tasks that
            involve human interpretation. <i>TerraVeta's</i> domain expertise in aviation was absolutely
            essential, as their knowledge about the intricacies and what was needed
            helped us quickly hone a plan and build a system that works. By pairing with experts,
            you can learn many behind-the-scene intricacies that can address
            frustration points that aren't evident.
            After several weeks of debugging, testing and trying to
            break the software any way we could, there have been no errors noted,
            and we reduced hours worth of work down to a few seconds.
            We eventually sold the software to the main government contractor,
            a subsidiary of a Fortune 30 company, and are expanding our plans for automation
            development work in several different industries, including aviation.
            Overall, we learned that developing a flexible approach that breaks
            large projects into smaller chunks and pairing with experts in the
            domain will be our approach to all of our future development work.
