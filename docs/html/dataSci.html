        <h3>Data Science</h3>
        <p>We break data down into fundamental pieces, spend quite a bit of time
          understanding these base components, and then rebuild the analysis
          structures using the best tools and techniques available. 'Data
          Science' is an incredibly broad subject, but after several years
          working in data consulting, we've found that the largest hindrance to
          effective analytics is failing to discard the non-essential and letting
          complexity overwhelm the end goal.</p>

          <p>Our philosophy in Data Science follows the advice that Einstein gave -
          *Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.*
          By reducing the data and focusing on what is most important, it is much
          easier to assess accuracy, build effective calculations, and visualize it in
          a way that the decision makers can understand and take action.</p>

        <h4>Data Cleaning and Blending</h4>
        <p>We've included a few different articles on the data cleansing and blending process.
        This is perhaps one of the most underappreciated, yet important parts of any project. Data
        often comes from many different places, in many different formats, at different levels of
        granularity. This is the point that we find out what information we have, determine what
        information we're missing, clean it, standardize it make sure everything is accurate
        and reliable.    </p>
